## NCAA Colors - Summer 2020 - [Github](https://github.com/karsonkevin2/NCAA-Colors)
This project was undertaken out of curiosity to see how similar NCAA DI team colors are. The B1G Conference team colors caused this project since Nebraska, UW-Madison, IU all have similar team colors.

Data was obtained from through website which had already compiled this information. This information was then explored in Excel. A Visual Basic macro was created to ensure that the colors were visually represented rather than just a unsigned short. Even segmentation proved ineffective, so a clustering based strategy was adopted. The data was moved to MATLAB where meaningful 3D charts could be created of the derived color space.

## Alertlife - Spring 2019 - [Github](https://github.com/karsonkevin2/AlertLife)
This project was created for the course, Embedded Systems. The project was designed with a partner. 

We envisioned an understaffed elderly home where people may have a medical emergency. In order for the staff to be appropriately informed, we designed a system which monitors for someone falling down and then sounds an audible alarm and sends a Bluetooth transmission to a central monitoring computer.
